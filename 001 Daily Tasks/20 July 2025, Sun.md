#### A Basic Journal
Today has to be brutal. Woke up early, slept approx 5 hrs. Starting the day with dev, not having the fresh and active mind. Otherwise would've started with ml dl. <br>
Good Day. Tried very well, successfully did 3 session, mind wasn't very active and sharp. At least i tried fully. Mac screen time is close to 8h. Tomorrow will start the ML Project.
