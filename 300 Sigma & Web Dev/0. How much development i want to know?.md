I don't aim to master development. I just want to learn enough to fix bugs generated by LLMs. Today, I used Claude to generate code for a portfolio, providing only a basic HTML structure and simple instructions to include modern animations and designs since I'm not familiar with development yet. Claude produced 1,135 lines of code in a single file, well, it's obviously not usable but the result is impressive. It might take me a month to learn and code this.


My goal is to acquire the skills needed to instruct the LLM on how to fix issues. Iâ€™m not interested in writing HTML or CSS; instead, I plan to focus on key functionalities and backend coding, ensuring I don't overlook any crucial lines of code. That's my plan.
