### What is Decimal and Binary?
- `Dec` means 10 and `Bi` means 2.
- In general number system and Mathematics we have 10 digits to form anything while in computer we only have 2 digits, 0 and 1. It's more a conventional with respect to electricity.
- 0 means there is no flow of current and 1 means it's on and working.
- So the thumb rule for conversion is use of 10 and 2. Our number system is on base 10 and computer is on base 2.
## Decimal to Binary
- Keep dividing the number by 2 and the answer will be the reminders.
- Also there is a shortcut when we think like a switch on off.
	- $1 = 2^{0}$ On for 0th power = 1
	- $2 = 0*2^0 + 1*2^1 = 10$ Off for 0th power but on for 1st power 
	- $5 = 1*2^0 +0*2^1 + 1* 2^2 = 101$ 
- 0-th power will always be on for odd numbers.
