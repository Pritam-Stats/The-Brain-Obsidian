#### A Basic Journal
Yesterday, slept around 5.30 am, after thinking so much about what am i doing, how will i survive like this. I felt i am failing and losing to myself, everyday. But there is still a believe i can do better and i can achieve what i should have done by now. i haven't given my 100%, I know and i believe that with my 100% effort on myself i can do better and be happy with myself.

Today, woke up at 4 pm, but i wasn't frustrated, i am hoping i will be doing good in the recent days coming. I couldn't done the tasks today, but i think i can tomorrow. I want to stay consistent now. Development will be starting soon. Now just want to stay happy, in peace and just happy being myself not with external materials.
