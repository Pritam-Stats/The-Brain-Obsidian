Whatever can be solved using loops, can be solved using recursion as well.
The key meaining of recursion is keep calling the same function again, and the purpose is to break down a bigger problem to multiple smaller problems.
```
def func(x):
	print(x)
	return func(x-1)
```
but the most important thing in any recursive function is the *Base case*, where the function will end.

#### Recursion in math
$$f(x) = x^2 \quad => f(f(x)) = x^4 $$ this is recursion. Calling the same function.
### Factorial
$n! = n*(n-1)!$
$$f(n) = n* f(n-1)$$
This is the recurrence relation.

**The Smallest problem in the problem is the Base Case"**
```Python
def factorial(n:int) -> int:
if n == 0
return 1
return n * factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))
```
- It is the method of solving those computational problem where the problem depends on the smaller instances of the same problem.
### Recursion in Memory
Stores a *Stack* for every call a new stack frame gets created. and operates in *LIFO*. Means for a recursive function the base case returns first.

#### Print number is decreasing order

### All Codes

```
