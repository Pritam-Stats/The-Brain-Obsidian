#### A Basic Journal
Started Writing tasks at night, so that i don't need to think about the targets in the morning. They day wasn't bad considering i woke up much late, hopefully tomorrow will be good, still in the starting phase. </br>
`8.30 pm -` The Day didn't go according to the plan, will try to do most of the task before sleeping, will study at night. Technically i am starting my day at `8.30 pm` </br>
*I tried.*
