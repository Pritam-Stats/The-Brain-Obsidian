#### A Basic Journal
Yesterday slept around 5.30am. Feel sleepy now again. It's 2.15pm, writing the tasks till now, trying to get back again. I think i can. 
Web Dev is starting both excited and a little stressed about falling inconsistent again, i don't want to stop anymore, just want to keep going, want work hard happily. want to spend 10 12 hours with the laptop. Want to be a tech expert. Want to develop now. But 

Didn't feel well today, feeling illness, maybe sleep deprived, couldn't done much today, tried. Hopefully tomorrow will be good.
