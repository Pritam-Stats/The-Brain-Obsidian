#### A Basic Journal
Hoping for an Effective day. <br>
It's 3.45 Pm and i haven't started, still facing problem with sleep and schedule.
It's a break day, i couldn't do anything but it's a good family time. Been with my brother, father. A good discussion, conversation. Overall a good day but not good as my performance should be. Tomorrow has to be very very good.
