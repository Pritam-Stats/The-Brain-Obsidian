And There is computer which remains on 24/7, and whenever some data is needed we ask that computer to share the data, that is nothing but a server, which stores various data and gives us chance to access that whenever needed with the correct credentials, the computer which ask for an information is called *Client*.

##### IP Address
Each and every computer has their unique address, both server and client has their own IP.
##### How internet works?
Client searches something (Make a req) and that requests, at first, been sends to ISP (Internet Service Provider, like Jio, Airtel), then ISP Sends transfers the req to *DNS (Domain Main System) Server*, it's like a AddressBook where all the IP Address has been stored when a req came, DNS Sends the IP of the requested domain to ISP and ISP Sends back to us (client).
- Search Google in [DNS, To know the IP](https://www.nslookup.io/).

Building Websites for the internet.
When we search for a website `amazon.in`, it sends the request to the corresponding server, that server sends the package of codes to the browser and the website gets displayed. - This is called *Request-Response Cycle.*
