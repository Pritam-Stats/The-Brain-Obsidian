- The beginning of [[02. Neural Networks]] 
- In the beginning it could only solve Linearly Separable problem hence failed in more complex tasks like The [[03.1 XOR Problem]]
- This limitation led to the development of **Multi-Layer Perceptron**
	- Introduced hidden layers  and non-linear activation functions.
	- [[03.11 MLPs]] are trained trained using [[Backward Propagation]] could model complex, non-linear relationships marking a significant leap in [[02. Neural Networks]] Capabilities.
- This development from perceptron to MLPs laid the ground work for advanced Architectures like [[Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)]] and [[Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)]]
- It follows the technique of [[Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN)]]

Now [[02.1 Types of Neural Networks]]
