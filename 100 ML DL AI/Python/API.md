## Intro
- API connects the frontend to the backend. it's act like a messenger that takes a request from the client system to the server system, tells the what to do and brings back the response to the client machine
	- Imagine you go to a **restaurant**:
		**Menu** = API documentation
		**Waiter** = API
		**Kitchen** = Server/Backend
		**Food** = Data/Service you get in response
- **API Key** is like a password the original host of the model provides to use the model via API. Similar to a web login password.
