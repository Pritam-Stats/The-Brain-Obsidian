- DB is *Collection of Data* in a format that can be easily accessed, Digital Storage.
- A software app which manage our DB is called DBMS. We use SQL for interacting with DBMS.

**Types of DB**:
1. *Relational DB* - Data stores in a structured format in a table. We use RDBMS
	- MySQL is a kind of such RDBMS
	- Others are Oracle, [[SQL]] Server, PostgreSQL
2. *Non-Relational DB* (NoSQL)
	- Data are not stored in structure or Table format rather in JSON format.
	- It's easier to handle.
	- MongoDB

## Database Structure
- We have multiple tables which stores inter-related data.
	- For example, if we making a DB for a company then one table will store Employee names, one is salary, one will the role of the employee. So the Data will be related.
- Table Format![[Table_DB_Lecture_ApnaCollege.png]]
	- Columns tells us the structure, all the information that is there in the table, in the language of database these columns also called *Schema* (design)
	- Rows will tell us the individual data

### Intro
- DB is a software which gives us an organised way to store manage and retrieve data easily.
- There are multiple DB Solutions. But there two primary systems of managing DBs.
	1. Relational (RDBMS)
		- Stored in Table Format
		- All interfaces like MySql MS Sql PgSql etc all derived from sql queries. Might not be same but based on sql
		- ACID Compliance
	2. NoSql (Non-Relational)
		- [[MongoDB]], Redis, Cassandra
		- Every DB has their own way to manage but these are not like query language.
