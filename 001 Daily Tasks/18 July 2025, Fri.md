#### A Basic Journal
Need to start doing everything strategically. <br>Couldn't do anything, trying to fix my sleep. Everything forward to tomorrow. Don't know how much i will be able to do tomorrow as well, since i am not going to sleep, will try to sleep directly tomorrow night. I don't have any option other than waking up at early morning. <br>There is an option that, i stay late night but i am not being able to stay productive at night.
Let's see what happens. *Not giving up.*
