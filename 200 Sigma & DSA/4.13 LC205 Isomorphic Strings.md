### Summary Description:
- Determine whether two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic — meaning there exists a one-to-one mapping between characters of `s` and `t` that preserves order and uniqueness.
- No two different characters in `s` may map to the same character in `t`, but a character may map to itself.
---
## Strategy & Key Insights
- Iterate through both strings simultaneously.
- Use two hash maps to record mappings `s → t` and `t → s` to enforce bijection.
- At each character position, verify that the current mapping is consistent with the previous mappings.
- If any inconsistency is found (either direction), conclude that the strings are not isomorphic.
- This ensures the mapping is injective and surjective in the context of the given strings.

## PseudoCode (Optimal)
```Python
function isIsomorphic(s, t):

if length of s != length of t:

return False

create empty map s_to_t

create empty map t_to_s

for each pair of characters (c1, c2) in s and t:

if c1 is already mapped in s_to_t:

if s_to_t[c1] != c2:

return False

else:

s_to_t[c1] = c2

if c2 is already mapped in t_to_s:

if t_to_s[c2] != c1:

return False

else:

t_to_s[c2] = c1


return True

```
